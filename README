Introduction
===================
MCF Gthread 是为 Windows 7 及更高版本的 Windows 设计的高效 Gthread 实现，用于移植 GCC 的用途。
MCF Gthread is a Gthread implementation for Windows 7 and above that meets the requirements of Gthread interfaces, playing a role as a replacement for the (currently working but smelly and inefficient) ghtr-win32 implementation when porting GCC.

C++0x 线程目前尚未实现，因为 __gthread_time_t 的机制尚不明确。
目前包含一次性初始化、互斥体、递归互斥体、条件变量和线程局部存储的功能已经实现。
The C++0x thread interfaces are currently unimplemented because it is yet unclear how __gthread_time_t works.
All the other features including once-initialization, mutex, recursive mutex, condition variable and thread local storage (TLS) have been implemented.
